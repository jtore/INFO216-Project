Aggregation: 

- Look at Annotations
	- hasEntity
	
- When you discover similar items 
	- How to put them together 
	- Make a new "big-item" or "event" 
		- if there are a lot items concerning similar experiences
		- Annotations can be rated with confidence 
		
Instead of analysing the text over and over
	- We want to do the semantic analysis on the way in
	- We want to use the late analysis using the knowledge graph 
	- Use knowledgegraphs

- Text in nodes is for understanding the data

- Techniques for aggregation
	- Clustering
	- Graph analysis

- Basic algorithm first
	- That keeps track of time and place
	- Pretend we work with a timeline
		- Where items arrive in a sequence 
		
- Keep track of entities 
	- But with decay of information 
	
- Not only looking at exact mentions 

- We are working with realtime datastreams 
	- There will be overlap
	
Problems with data:

Twitter news items will possibly have few items 
	- Problems with lack of data
News article items will possibly have very many items
    - Too much data too handle
